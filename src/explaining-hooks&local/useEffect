What does useEffect return?
The return function is the cleanup function, or when the user leaves the page and the component will unmount. 
The array is the last part, and it is where you put the states that will update throughout the component's lifecycle. 
You can discard the array if your component won't update during its lifecycle.
Q-2
Does useEffect run after every render?
Ans- Yes! By default, it runs both after the first render and after every update. (We will later talk about how to customize this.)
Instead of thinking in terms of “mounting” and “updating”, you might find it easier to think that effects happen “after render”. 
React guarantees the DOM has been updated by the time it runs the effects.

Q-3 Why is useEffect called inside a component?
Ans-  We don’t need a special API to read it — it’s already in the function scope.
Hooks embrace JavaScript closures and avoid introducing React-specific APIs where JavaScript already provides a solution.
